The files contained here detail the steps demonstrated to attendees at the R Studio sessions as part of the 2015 Data Tools Forum.

The .Rmd file shows the processes presented for both the session on data wrangling and data analysis using visualization. The HTML file generated by the R code, along with the handout distributed to attendees prior to the event, are also available here.
