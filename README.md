The files contained here detail the steps demonstrated to attendees durring the R Studio sessions at the 2015 Data Tools Forum.

The .Rmd and HTML files show the processes presented for both the session on data wrangling and on data analysis using visualization. These files can also be seen rendered in R Pubs [here](http://rpubs.com/dbouquin/DataTools_2015). The handout distributed to attendees prior to the event is also available [public dropbox link].
